## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the GitHub repository.
2. Upload the plugin to your WooCommerce site via **Plugins > Add New** or extract the ZIP file and upload the `send24-shipping` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
4. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Send24 Logistics** to configure your API keys and other settings.

## Configuration

### API Keys

- Navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Send24 Logistics**.

### Mode (Test/Live)

- In the **Send24 Logistics** settings, you will find an option to switch between **Test Mode** and **Live Mode**.
- When **Test Mode** is enabled, the plugin will use the test API key for order creation, allowing you to test without creating real shipments.

### Set Up Delivery Options

- On the checkout page, the **Send24 Shipping** option will be available in the shipping methods section.
- When **Send24 Shipping** is selected, a modal will appear with two delivery options:

  1. **Hub Delivery**: Customers can select a hub near their destination address.
  2. **Door Delivery**: The package is delivered directly to the customerâ€™s address.

- For **Hub Delivery**, customers will be presented with a list of nearby hubs based on the entered destination address and can select their preferred hub for pickup.

## Order Creation Flow

1. When the customer completes an order and selects **Send24 Shipping**, the plugin will trigger the Send24 order creation process via the **woocommerce_thankyou** hook.
2. The plugin collects order details such as:
   - Customer name
   - Shipping address
   - Chosen delivery method (Hub or Door)
   - Selected hub (if Hub Delivery is chosen)
   - Product details (size, fragility, label)
3. The order is then sent to the **Send24 API** using the appropriate API key (Test or Live, based on settings).
4. Upon successful creation, the order information is logged and visible in the **WooCommerce Orders** section.
